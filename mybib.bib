  abstract = {The subject of graphical methods for data analysis and for data presentation
	needs a scientific foundation. In this article we take a few steps
	in the direction of establishing such a foundation. Our approach
	is based on graphical perception-the visual decoding of information
	encoded on graphs-and it includes both theory and experimentation
	to test the theory. The theory deals with a small but important piece
	of the whole process of graphical perception. The first part is an
	identification of a set of elementary perceptual tasks that are carried
	out when people extract quantitative information from graphs. The
	second part is an ordering of the tasks on the basis of how accurately
	people perform them. Elements of the theory are tested by experimentation
	in which subjects record their judgments of the quantitative information
	on graphs. The experiments validate these elements but also suggest
	that the set of elementary tasks should be expanded. The theory provides
	a guideline for graph construction: Graphs should employ elementary
	tasks as high in the ordering as possible. This principle is applied
	to a variety of graphs, including bar charts, divided bar charts,
	pie charts, and statistical maps with shading. The conclusion is
	that radical surgery on these popular graphs is needed, and as replacements
	we offer alternative graphical forms-dot charts, dot charts with
	grouping, and framed-rectangle charts.},

	predict each of these perceptual peculiarities. These findings imply

	representation as a high-dimensional data analysis tool. Several
	alternatives are reviewed. The basic algorithm for parallel coordinates
	is laid out and a discussion of its properties as a projective transformation
	is given. Several duality results are discussed along with their
	interpretations as data analysis tools. Permutations of the parallel
	coordinate axes are discussed, and some examples are given. Some
	extensions of the parallel coordinate idea are given. The article
	closes with a discussion of implementation and some of my experiences.},
