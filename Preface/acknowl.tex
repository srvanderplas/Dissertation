\specialchapt{ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS}

I would like to thank Dr. Heike Hofmann for her guidance and support throughout this research. I could not have finished this work without her encouragement and direction. 
I would also like to thank my committee, for their time and suggestions for future work in graphical perception. 

My statistics education was mostly at Iowa State, but before I became a statistician, Dr. Rachel Hull taught me how to think like a psychologist. Without her, it would have been much more difficult to pursue this avenue of research.

Finally, I would like to thank my father and first statistics professor, Dr. Bruce Koons. He taught me what a standard deviation was conceptually before I could ride a bike, and has encouraged me in every project I've ever started.
