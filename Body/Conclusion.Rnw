\chapter{CONCLUSION}
The work presented in the previous chapters emphasizes the importance of considering the human visual system when using graphics to communicate numerical data and statistical results. Graphics provide a method of communicating statistical information efficiently, but we must ensure that the information is also conveyed accurately. 

Designing graphics for this goal requires that we understand the quirks of the visual system: the illusions and errors which occur due to misapplication of heuristics which work well in the natural world but do not translate to artificial images, such as data displays. We must also consider the skills required to read the graphics we create: some plots require explanations to understand the data presented (box plots and control charts, for instance), while others may require visual skills such as color perception or the ability to rotate in two dimensions. While the study presented in Chapter \ref{visualreasoning} determined that general plot evaluation (using lineups) did not appear to require any specific visual skills, more work is necessary. It is not difficult to imagine that polar coordinate plots may require some rotational ability, or that three-dimensional projections may require three-dimensional spatial manipulation skills. Finally, it is important that we construct our plots carefully, adding aesthetics which enhance our ability to see relevant information while minimizing unnecessary complexity. Chapter \ref{featurehierarchy} presents some initial results which attempt to clarify which aesthetics are most useful for emphasizing clustering compared with linear relationships. More work is necessary to ensure these results are robust with respect to palette choices and modeling decisions, but these results lay the groundwork for evidence-based guidelines for clearly communicating statistical results using graphics.

The visual system is incredibly complex; graphics designed with the visual system in mind require consideration of feature recognition, color perception, attention and limits on short-term memory, and many other perceptual factors. More research into the impact of attention and short-term memory limitations on perception of statistical graphics is essential; this low-level research is critical to our understanding of limits on visual bandwidth. As interactive graphics become more prevalent, using the internet as a distribution medium, we must understand the limits of human perceptual abilities lest we create interactive, animated graphics which overwhelm the visual system and fail to communicate our results clearly. 

Graphics are the primary means by which statistical results are communicated to the general population; by understanding how these graphics are perceived, we can communicate results to a wider audience more accurately. More experimental work is necessary to understand graphical perception clearly so that we can move beyond heuristics for graphical design.
