\chapter{CONCLUSION}
The work presented in the previous chapters emphasizes the importance of considering the human visual system when using graphics to communicate numerical data and statistical results. Graphics provide a method of communicating statistical information efficiently, but we must ensure that the information is also conveyed accurately. 

Designing graphics for this goal requires that we understand the quirks of the visual system: the illusions and errors we make when viewing artificially generated data displays. We must also consider the skills required to read the graphics we create: some plots require explanations to understand the data presented (box plots and control charts, for instance), while others may require visual skills such as color perception or the ability to infer patterns and identify areas which do not conform to the inferred pattern. Finally, it is important that we construct our plots carefully, adding aesthetics which enhance our ability to see relevant information while minimizing unnecessary complexity. Chapter \ref{featurehierarchy} presents some initial results which attempt to clarify which aesthetics are most useful for emphasizing clustering compared with linear relationships. More work is necessary to ensure these results are robust with respect to palette choices and modeling decisions, but these results lay the groundwork for evidence-based guidelines for clearly communicating statistical results using graphics.

There are many opportunities for future work related to the studies presented here. The study presented in Chapter \ref{visualreasoning} determined that general plot evaluation (using lineups) did not appear to require any specific visual skills, more work is necessary. It is not difficult to imagine that polar coordinate plots may require some rotational ability, or that three-dimensional projections may require three-dimensional spatial manipulation skills. The work in Chapter \ref{featurehierarchy} also should be expanded to establish the effect of different bounding regions, as well as the visual impact of outliers  and other common artifacts in plotted data. 

More foundational research into the perception of statistical graphics is necessary as well. Experiments exploring the impact of attention and short-term memory limitations on comprehension of statistical graphics would provide quantitative evidence to guide the creation of visually optimal plots. Quantification of perceived color differences (such as \citet{heer:2014}) would also provide a basis for graphical researchers to control for the effect of color palette choice in experimental design.

Graphics are the primary means by which statistical results are communicated to the general population; by understanding how these graphics are perceived, we can communicate results to a wider audience more accurately. This dissertation addresses several issues in the perception of statistical graphics: optical illusions, visual skills necessary for graph perception, and the salience of visual features. More experimental work is necessary to understand graphical perception clearly so that we can move beyond heuristics for graphical design.
